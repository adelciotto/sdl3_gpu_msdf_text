# SDL3 GPU MSDF TEXT EXAMPLE

This repository contains example code for efficiently drawing text using multichannel signed distance field (MSDF) texture atlases using SDL3 and the GPU API.

The texture atlases are generated at build time using Chlumsky's [msdf-atlas-gen](https://github.com/Chlumsky/msdf-atlas-gen).
